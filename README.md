# Learn-Ethical-Hacking-by-Solving-Real-Security-Challenges

Abstract
```
   It can be difficult for any teacher to introduce technical concepts to students who have
little or no technical expertise. Gamification is a term that has lately been used to de-
scribe a strategy for motivating students that involves incorporating various game-based
strategies into instructional modules. This idea has led to the discovery that capture
the flag (CTF)-style competitions are an effective approach to introduce students to a
number of technical ideas within the traditional computer science curriculum. A CTF
was conducted at numerous GenCyber camps across the nation with the main objec-
tive of educating high school students to various computer security and digital forensics
issues without necessitating any prior knowledge on the part of the students.We dis-
covered that this approach of breaking things down into discrete problems and linking
these difficulties together in a competitive setting was remarkably successful at not
just introducing kids to these concepts but also inspiring continuing learning after the
camps concluded. This Project will evaluate the effortâ€™s accomplishments as well as the
drawbacks identified by applying this method.
